# Blood-Donation-Management-System
This project in SQL uses a database to store information about medical patients. When designing the database or thinking about the data you want to store or query, consider the patient's name, unique ID, blood type, medical history, and phone number as a starting point.

Itâ€™s also a good idea to create an Entity-Relationship (E-R) diagram and a schema to start implementing these fields within a database before trying to normalize it.
